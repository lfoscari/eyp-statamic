  Born and raised in the fantastic frame of Turin, since always interested in the social and political
  dynamics. Lover of traveling and fascinated by foreign languages. I am now studying International
  Sciences for cooperation and development at Turin University. Part of EYP since 2014, since 2016 I
  am part of the new Governing Council. I hope in this year to give back to the association at least a
  part of what it has given to me.
