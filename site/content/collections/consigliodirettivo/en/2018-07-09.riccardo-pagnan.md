bio: "I love challenges, second opportunities and surprises, three characteristics that sum up my life and describe how I entered EYP in 2014. From that moment on I participated in sessions in 11 different countries, first as a delegate then as a Chairperson or Vice-President. I love to travel, discover new realities and learn new things, all a brief summary of the opportunities EYP offered me.  If I had to describe myself in 100 worlds, I'd say I am very ambitious and when I fix myself an objective I aim higher as I can get, to overcome my limits."
