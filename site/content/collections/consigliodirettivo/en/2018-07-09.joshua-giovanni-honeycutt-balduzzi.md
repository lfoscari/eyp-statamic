role: Secretary
bio: 'Born in 1992, Im in my second mandate on the Governing Council of the European Youth Parliament. Member of the Federalist moment since 2013, I firmly believe that both Europe and Italy need to propose themselves as a flagship of culture, justice and rights on a global scene. Also for this reason I chose an education of strong humanistic imprinting: a diploma form the classical High School of my city Pordenone, a degree in Classics and I am obtaining one in classical Philology. In my daily life I am mainly engaged in historical linguistic and Europe. Since November 2017 I work for the Mediafriuli group.'
