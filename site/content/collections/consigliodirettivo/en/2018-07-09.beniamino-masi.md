role: President
bio: 'Im a collector of Hobbies and different interests: graphic design, programming, mobile phones, languages, politics, guitar, piano, juggling and track. At the same time you may not define me neither a juggler nor a programmer. Even less an athlete. I study Political Science in Pisa since 2015. Two years earlier I participated in my first EYP event in Lucca. From that moment on all the other hobbies I had became less relevant. '
