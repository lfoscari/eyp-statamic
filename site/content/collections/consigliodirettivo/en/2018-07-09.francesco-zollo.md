role: Media and Communication
bio: "Tuscan from birth, raised in Volterra, between art music and culture enclosed in-between the walls of the Etruscan city. It was this that pushed me to have a morbid interest in communication methods, on how to send a message in an efficient and effective way. I'm a videomaker who makes professional level videos without actually being a professional, that has fun creating inventing and sperimenting. I started my experience in EYP in 2015 and continue to the day to be fascinated by this Association, enough to be part of the Governing Council since 2016. I study Economics and International Relations at Luigi Bocconi Commercial University."
