role: Tresurer
bio: 'Twenty two year old, economics student, born and raised the cultural diversity of Trieste. My activity in EYP started in May 2014. From that moment on I had the luck of coming into contact with the infinte portals of opportunities offered from the integration of different European realities: Turkey, Finland and Germany my very first destinations. As for my personal interests I can assert that -unfortunately- I am a big fan of TV series and movies, always able to absorb more time than predicted; in the musical context I would say Dire Straits, Guccini and De Andr√® are not open to discussion for me, while in the literal context I nurture an unconditional love for the great Italian Classics. But before that I devote myself with passion to the growth of this fantastic association to whom I still have to give back so much. '
