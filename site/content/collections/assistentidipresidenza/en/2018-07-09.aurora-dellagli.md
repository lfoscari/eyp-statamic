role: Assistant to Presidency with delegation to National Preselection and School Internship programs
bio: 'I am at my second year studying Law at the University of Padova. My accent cheats on my Sicilian and Salentine origins, even though since I was seven I found myself a wanderer that has lived in two many cities  to list. This life has not been so simple, but allowed me to find myself in the right moment in the only Ligurian high school that in 2015 was bringing a delegation to the National Selection in Turin. From that moment on I never stopped:  being a wanderer, now around all over Europe, has never been this exciting. '
