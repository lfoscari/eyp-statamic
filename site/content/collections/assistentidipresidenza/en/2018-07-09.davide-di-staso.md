role: Assistants to Presidency with Delegation to Media and Communication
bio: >
  Born in Rome and raised in a small Sicilian Village. I discovered EYP in an event at Riva del Garda
  in 2015 and from that moment I had the chance of constantly traveling around Europe. I decided to
  study Political Science at LUISS in Rome because I thought I would be able to understand politics in
  their complexity but the more I study, more this prospect seems farther away. I am nor able to
  Photograph nor draw, we could say that I do things in the Media and Communication team.
