role: Assistant to presidency with delegation to Human Resources
bio: 'Born in Trieste in 1997 from an Irish father and Italian Mother, I am now a second year student studying  International and Diplomatic Science in Gorizia. I am member of the European Youth Parliament since 2014 and since March 2018 I am Assistant to Presidency. EYP during the years offered me the chance of traveling all over Europe in an open and stimulating environment and I hope with this mandate to give back to the organization a bit of what it has given to me.
