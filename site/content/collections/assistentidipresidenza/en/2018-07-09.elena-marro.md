role: Assistant to presidency with delegation to Fundraising
bio: "I consider human error and the need to learn from one's mistakes necessary, the important thing is not to fall but to be able to get back on your feet. Born and raised in the Alps that corner Cuneo, the mountains are one of the things that miss most in my life as an off-site student. Having been fascinated since forever with the world of social and political relations, I found in EYP an environment to develop and discover new interests. My path in the Association started in 2014 and brought me to discover different countries, from Finland to Armenia. I consider myself made by the people I met, the stories I was told and experiences I helped create."
