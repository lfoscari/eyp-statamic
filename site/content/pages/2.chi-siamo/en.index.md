  **From 2004, the Schwarzkopf Young Europe (Schwarzkopf-Stiftung Junges Europa) Foundation, based in Berlin, is the umbrella organization of the European Youth Parliament, along with the legal representative of EYP at an international level.**
  
  The independent foundation Schwarzkopf was founded in 1971. From that moment the foundation aims to support the development of young citizens informed on politics  and responsible. The Foundation particularly concentrates itself on:
  
  - strengthening the European project,
  - advancement of the pan-European understanding,
  - strengthening of the civil democratic society,
  - battling racism, right wing extremism and antisemitism.
  
  With a great variety of events, seminars debates, encounters in embassies, discussions and conferences on Europe that include direct exchange with key actors in politics, economics, culture and civil society, the Schwarzkopf Foundation offers a platform of discussion.
  
  Just as the program of EYP, also the Schwarzkopf Foundation is an organization based on fundraising, researching external financing for all its projects and events.
