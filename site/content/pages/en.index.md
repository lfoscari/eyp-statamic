  text: "Not only I thought of abandoning, I effectively stopped participating in EYP for a year; especially because I was concentrating on different things in my life but also because I was not agreeing with the direction the organization was taking. Moreover I was in Argentina and it was hard for me to participate at events. But then the association stated to miss me very much: I realized of the various aspects of my life that had been influenced by how I worked in EYP and I understood that I had to move forward and grow in the association to be able to grow in my personal projects.  So I decided to join again, also because I simply missed the people. Last year I was part of Riva del Garda National Selection, which made me change idea on the level of my involvement: I understood I was now at a completely different level and I was very happy, now I'm here and I can't stop!"
