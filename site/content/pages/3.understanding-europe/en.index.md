    title: Short courses to share a basic knowledge of the EU
    text: >
      Understanding Europe is a programme by the Schwarzkopf Stiftung foundation and the European Youth
      Parliament that is aimed at providing young students with a basic knowledge of the structures of the
      European Union and its functioning, while at the same time raising awareness about european topics.
      The crash courses alternate periods of pure learning, focused on the european integration process
      and on the fundamental institutions and competences of the EU, with moments of debate and
      confrontation, during which students have the opportunity to express and exchange their own ideas on
      the big social and political topics, chosen by the students themselves.

    title: A new, informal and participatory method
    text: >
      To this date the programme is open to all upper-secondary level schools and is consists of compact
      courses lasting 4/5 hours destined to groups of no more than 30 students, even of different age and
      classes.

    title: Workshops that begin with students
    text: |
      Throughout many workshops the students find themselves mainly reflecting on the following questions: "Who's the European Union?", "Why does the EU exist?" and "What does the European Union do?". In particular, the project is aimed at providing students with a basic understanding of the main institutions of the European Unione: Commission, Parliament, Council of Ministers, Court of Justice, European Central Bank. The course provides a description of the composition of these institutions and, more importantly, functions and competences; special attention is paid to the most pressing and debated topics like Brexit or immigration. The activity is proposed both in Italian and English, at the discretion of teachers and/or participants.

    title: To enter your school
    text: >
      During the crash courses the students are split into groups and asked to complete some tasks so that
      they can later share the results with everyone else. In this way it is possible to train cross
      competences like problem solving, teamwork, the production of brief oral presentations and the
      ability to carry out an informed and civil debate. Going through the whole course in English can
      also result in a good linguistic exercise. Lastly, the students have also got the possibility to
      confront themselves with a technical vocabulary as well as a day to day vocabulary used in public
      debates and by the press.
